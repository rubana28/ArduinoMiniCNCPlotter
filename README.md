CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control. This machine draws a specific image which is specified by the computer in a specific area. Here, three software are required. Firstly, the image is given into INKSPACE software which creates a GCODE. The GCODE is needed for the machine and in order to understand the GCODE instructions, the machine should have its own code that we have uploaded using Arduino IDE software. Finally, Processing software is used to link the machineâ€™s code to the GCODE. I have also done the hardware part by using stepper motor, servo motor, DVD drive and etc.
